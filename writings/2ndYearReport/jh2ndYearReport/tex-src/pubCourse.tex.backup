Given that \texttt{KMCLib} has a Python frontend, a language with which I was not familiar, I took SUPA Python course this year. Other than that, I have attended no other courses, since, including that,
I believe I have already met all of my SUPA requirements.

As of yet, I have no publications. However, I would like to be ready to publish on the subject of the phenomenology of the one-dimensional lattice model described in~\ref{sec: modelChoice} by the end of the Summer.
